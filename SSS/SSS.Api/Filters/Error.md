# Problem Details for HTTP APIs

This project implements the Problem Details RFC specification (RFC 7807) for HTTP APIs using ASP.NET Core. The specification defines a way to carry machine-readable details of errors in a HTTP response to avoid the need to define new error response formats for HTTP APIs.

## Background

Problem Details is a standardized way to convey error information in a HTTP API response. It defines a JSON object to include specific details about an error, such as:

- `type`: A URI reference that identifies the problem type.
- `title`: A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.
- `status`: The HTTP status code generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem.
- `detail`: A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem.
- `instance`: A URI that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem.

This format allows API clients to understand and handle error responses more effectively.

## Installation

To use Problem Details in your ASP.NET Core application, you need to add the necessary package to your project:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core
```

## Usage
To return a Problem Details response, you can use the ProblemDetails class provided by ASP.NET Core. Here's how you can implement it in a controller:


using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class ExampleController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("error")]
    public IActionResult GetError()
    {
        var problemDetails = new ProblemDetails
        {
            Type = "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
            Title = "You do not have enough credit.",
            Status = StatusCodes.Status400BadRequest,
            Detail = "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
            Instance = HttpContext.Request.Path
        };

        return BadRequest(problemDetails);
    }
}


- Example
Here's an example response when the GetError endpoint is called:


{
  "type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
  "title": "You do not have enough credit.",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
  "instance": "/example/error"
}
